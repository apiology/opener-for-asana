This isn't in the Chrome App Store and doesn't have any cool config
UI, so welcome to the Chrome Extension development experience!

   start webpack in watch mode.
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Make sure 'Developer mode' is flipped on in the upper right.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked' button.
5. Choose the [dist](./dist) directory
